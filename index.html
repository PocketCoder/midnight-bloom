                    <p>I began writing Midnight Bloom as a distraction. It scratched an itch that kept
                        me going through lockdown, unemployment, and a post-uni crisis, where I was
                        deciding which direction I wanted my life to go.</p>
                        <br />
                    <p>The initial idea stuck with me because it was a story I hadn’t seen told. I grew up
                        surrounded by a masculinity that was, very present but nevertheless always out
                        of reach for me. I wanted to explore this theme, having characters live their lives
                        partly through the lens of my own experience. I wanted characters that most
                        audiences would stereotype – people that might be written oﬀ and given little
                        careful thought. Then I could expose their feelings and their sides unseen. How
                        would love prevail over restrictive hyper-masculinity, societal expectations, and
                        a whole host of other odds?</p>
                        <br />
                    <p>Through the writing process I explored my own identity and my experiences
                        growing up. My perspective undoubtedly shaped the script and the characters. I
                        wanted to see if love would endure its exposure to criticism and ridicule in Aaron
                        and Jamie’s world. I wanted to test the connection a father has with his
                        daughter, and demonstrate that there’s room for it alongside other personal
                        bonds. I hoped, and still do, that seeing male tenderness, male love, and male
                        friendship on screen invites conversation, connection, and, dare I say, change.</p>
                        <br />
                    <p>I currently work at a youth club and see all diﬀerent manifestations of young life,
                        with its struggles, hopes and opportunities. I have the privilege of sharing lives
                        with young people as they grow. I’ve seen softer, more tender sides being lost
                        and gradually regained on complex journeys of discovery. Midnight Bloom exists
                        to show how two halves of ourselves can exist as one. Media representations of
                        these things have moved a long way since I was in school, even since I started
                        university, but I want to push it further. I want to be a part of the conversation. I
                        want to add to the collection of great films that explore life growing up in a poor
                        city, being trapped by circumstance, and having the resolve to power through
                        regardless. The script, for me, is about finding everything good about life,
                        whatever our circumstances, and pushing that to the forefront of our vision.</p>
